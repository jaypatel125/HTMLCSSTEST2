	<h1>Canada</h1>
	
	<h2>Provinces and Territories</h2>
	
	<p>The provinces and territories of Canada are sub-national divisions within 
	the geographical areas of Canada under the jurisdiction of the Canadian 
	Constitution. In the 1867 Canadian Confederation, three provinces of 
	British North America—New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and the Province of 
	Canada (which upon Confederation was divided into Ontario and Quebec)—were 
	united to form a federated colony, becoming a sovereign nation in the next 
	century. Over its history, Canada's international borders have changed 
	several times, and the country has grown from the original four provinces 
	to the current ten provinces and three territories. Together, the 
	provinces and territories make up the world's second-largest country by 
	total area.</p>

	<p>The major difference between a Canadian province and a territory is that 
	provinces receive their power and authority from the Constitution Act, 
	1867 (formerly called The British North America Act, 1867), whereas 
	territorial governments have powers delegated to them by the Parliament of 
	Canada. The powers flowing from the Constitution Act are divided between 
	the Government of Canada (the federal government) and the provincial 
	governments to exercise exclusively. A change to the division of powers 
	between the federal government and the provinces requires a constitutional 
	amendment, whereas a similar change affecting the territories can be 
	performed unilaterally by the Parliament of Canada or government.</p>

	<h2>History - 20<sup>th</sup> Century</h2>
	
	<p>In 1873 John A. Macdonald (First Prime Minister of Canada) created the 
	North-West Mounted Police (now the Royal Canadian Mounted Police) to help 
	police the Northwest Territories. Specifically the Mounties were to assert 
	Canadian sovereignty over possible American encroachments into the area. 
	The Mounties' first large-scale mission was to suppress the second 
	independence movement by Manitoba's Métis, a mixed blood people of joint 
	First Nations and European descent, who originated in the mid-17th 
	century. The desire for independence erupted in the Red River Rebellion in 
	1869 and the later North-West Rebellion in 1885 led by Louis Riel. 
	Suppressing the Rebellion was Canada's first independent military action. 
	It cost about $5 million and demonstrated the need to complete the 
	Canadian Pacific Railway. It guaranteed Anglophone control of the 
	Prairies, and demonstrated the national government was capable of decisive 
	action. However, it lost the Conservative Party most of their support in 
	Quebec and led to permanent distrust of the Anglophone community on the 
	part of the Francophones.</p>
	
	<p>As Canada expanded, the Canadian government rather than the British Crown, 
	negotiated treaties with the resident First Nations' peoples, organizing 
	them onto reserve lands. The government imposed the Indian Act in 1876 to 
	govern the relations between the federal government and the Indigenous 
	peoples and govern the relations between the new settlers and the 
	Indigenous peoples. Under the Indian Act, the government started the 
	Residential School System to integrate the Indigenous peoples and 
	'civilize' them.</p>
